University web-GIS assignment project
This was an introductory course to web-based GIS and it included basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also introduced FOSS packages like OpenLayers and GeoServer. 
The assignment required the creation of a simple website with an incorporated range of languages introduced during the module. 
This small website presents a fictitious volunteering organization whose main goal is to eradicate the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) by mapping. 
The overall design of the project is simple and uniform in the form of fonts, colors, and layouts. 
The website was hosted on GeoServer and was tested in Google Chrome and Firefox. All the elements were loading properly in both browsers. 
Originally, the website was hosted through AWS on Virtual Machine (VM). 
However, after the course, I have lost student privileges so I decided to host a website for free on InfinityFree hosting service.

The website:
